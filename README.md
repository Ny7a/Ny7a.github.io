Hello, welcome to my <a href="https://ny7a.github.io/" target="_blank">portfolio!</a>
 <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools</a> 
 I created this using HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript and NPM Package Manager.  

The portfolio consists of four main pages; a Home, About, Work, and Contact Me page. 
Navigating to each one of these pages is made easy through the use of a menu button which opens up an overlay containing a navigation option to each one of the pages. 

The menu button &overlay were created using CSS transitons & the transform property. It's activation was made possible using JavaScript.
The About and Work pages employ the use of Grid CSS & template areas. 
The Contact page utilizes flex box, and a hover effect created through CSS transitions.
